== Description ==
The QuickReviewer Proofing plugin for WordPress is used for proofing HTML websites in the QuickReviewer Proofing module. For more information on the plugin, visit https://www.quickreviewer.com and head to knowledgebase articles.

This plugin works only along with the 3rd party QuickReviewer service. In order for this plugin to work, you will need to create an account at https://www.quickreviewer.com/quickreviewer/reviewmanager/#/register. Once you have created an account, you can use the QuickReviewer platform to add your website links and send them out for review to your stake holders. The stake holders get an email with a link to review and can add comments or provide feedback without the need to send emails back and forth. But before you do that, you will need to install this plugin on your WordPress website. 

To get a summary about how it works, follow the link https://www.quickreviewer.com/how-quickreviewer-works/. Or dive into our short video tutorials at https://www.quickreviewer.com/video-tutorials/

Once the review process is over you can just deactivate/uninstall the plugin. We take security and privacy of our user very seriously. You can read about our privacy policy at https://www.quickreviewer.com/privacy-policy/.
